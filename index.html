            <p>Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean
                 the products resulting from such efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones 
                 such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life</p>
                 <p>Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times,
                     followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age.
                      The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, 
                      including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.</p>

            <p>A century since scientists proposed that excess carbon dioxide in earth’s atmosphere would
                 cause it to retain heat and cause planetary warming, a global effort is underway to
                  drive decarbonization in all aspects of daily life. Governments and industries have made seminal 
                  commitments to reduce carbon emissions.

                Meeting those commitments will, over the next three to five years,
                 demand unprecedented innovation
                 and scaling to industrial levels of nascent technologies
                  such as: mass energy storage, low/no carbon chemical sources, revitalized rail 
                  transport, carbon sequestration, low carbon agriculture, zero emission vehicles 
                  and power sources, as well as agreed-upon compliance monitoring on a global scale.</p>

            <p>People often ask me about the real-life potential for inhumane,
                 merciless systems like Hal 9000 or the Terminator to destroy our society.

                Growing up in Belgium and away from Hollywood,
                 my initial impressions of robots were not so violent.
                  In retrospect, my early positive affiliations with robots likely fueled my drive
                   to build machines to make our everyday lives more enjoyable. Robots working alongside
                    humans to manage day-to-day mundane tasks was a world I wanted to help create.</p>

            <p>Nanotechnology is one of the most promising key enabling technologies 
              of the 21st century. The field of nanotechnology was foretold in Richard Feynman’s
              famous 1959 lecture “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom”, (1) and the term was
              formally defined in 1974 by Norio Taniguchi. (2) Thus, the field is now 
              approaching 50 years of research and application. It is a continuously 
              expanding area of research, contributing to almost every field of science─natural
              sciences and engineering, materials science, medicine, agriculture,
              information/communications technologies─and this list continues to grow.
             (3) Nanotechnology started coming into its own in the 1980s, gaining public exposure
             and awareness (including having to navigate some controversy),
             and commercial applications of the new technologies began.</p>

            <p>Flexible inorganic bioelectronics represent a newly emerging and rapid developing 
               research area. With its great power in enhancing the acquisition, management and utilization
               of health information, it is expected that these flexible and stretchable devices 
               could underlie the new solutions to human health problems. Recent advances in this area
               including materials, devices, integrated systems and their biomedical applications indicate 
               that through conformal and seamless contact with human body, the measurement becomes 
               continuous and convenient with yields of higher quality data</p>
